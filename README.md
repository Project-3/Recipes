# Recipes
This project was the third for the March 2015 iteration of General Assembly in New York City. All members were in the "Lemon" cohort. We were tasked with building an app as a group with specs and general workflow narrative linked to below. 

### Tools of the Trade
1. [Trello](https://trello.com/b/VzQ0EueS/general-assembly-project-three) was used to keep track of the comings and goings of the project overall. 

2. [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) made up our back-end.

3. [HTTParty](https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty) was used to do some initial data fetching from our API, [We Eatt](http://www.weeatt.com/)
