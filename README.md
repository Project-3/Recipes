# re:Frigerator 
This project was the third for the March 2015 iteration of General Assembly in New York City. All members were in the "Lemon" cohort. We were tasked during the second to last week of our program with building an app as a group with specs and general workflow narrative linked to below. 

re:Frigerator is an app that helps you indicate what items you have at home and aren't sure what you might want or can cook with those ingredients. 

To that end, you're presented with your most recently saved recipe upon login, whereupon you can also check out saved recipes and your inventory. You may toggle between whether or not you want your saved recipes at the forefront, ready for you to use once you get home and need to start cooking. 

Navigate to your inventory to add new ingredients from your stores. Update your list to reflect ingredients you're bound to have again or just delete ones you won't be using for a while. Click the search button and you can start exploring new recipes!

Our project is hosted [here](). 

### Tools of the Trade
1. [Trello](https://trello.com/b/VzQ0EueS/general-assembly-project-three) was used to keep track of the comings and goings of the project overall. 

2. [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) made up our back-end.

3. Our front-end was provided by [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) via the [backbone-on-rails](https://github.com/meleyal/backbone-on-rails) gem.

4. [HTTParty](https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty) was used to do some data fetching from our APIs, [We Eatt](http://www.weeatt.com/) and [Food2Fork](http://food2fork.com/about/api).

5. We did some basic model testing with [RSPEC](http://rspec.info/).

6. For styling purposes, most of it was done vanilla, but there is some utilization of [Pure](http://purecss.io/).
